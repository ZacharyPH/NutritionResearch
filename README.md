Web scraping to gather data for building a nutrition focused dieting network model

Built entirely in Python, using BeautifulSoup to fetch data from [FastFoodNutrition](https://fastfoodnutrition.org/).

Check out ```restaurants.txt``` for the list of 41 restaurants with data on FastFoodNutrition.

Read through ```main.py``` to see how the scraping was done, or take a look at the results in ```Nutritional Facts.xlsx```!
